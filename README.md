Project Title: UMR vs Nutrition: The Protein Minutes Index Across Indonesian Cities

Overview: 
**What if the time you spend working each day directly determined whether you could afford enough protein?** 
Protein, from the Greek protos meaning “primary,” is essential for human health. It fuels growth, repairs tissues, supports immunity, and sustains vital functions. Insufficient protein intake can reduce productivity, compromise immunity, and negatively impact overall well-being.
This analysis uses city- and commodity-level price data collected from January to August 2025 across DKI Jakarta and DIY.
This project explores protein accessibility across cities and regencies in DKI Jakarta and DIY by comparing local food prices with regional minimum wages. Using the Protein Minute Index (PMI)—the number of minutes a worker needs to earn enough for 65 grams of protein per day—we translate affordability into a human-centered, relatable metric rather than raw currency.
Through PMI, this project highlights:
1. Urban-rural disparities in protein access
2. Commodity-level affordability differences (chicken, eggs, mackerel, bandeng, and more)
3. Seasonal trends and local anomalies that affect nutrition availability
Our approach allows policymakers, researchers, and the public to easily understand and compare nutritional accessibility across regions, identify vulnerable populations, and inform data-driven interventions for improving protein affordability.

Insight and Findings:
**Who Works Longer to Eat?**

- Jakarta Selatan: PMI 14.15, workers spend far less time securing daily protein than city mean (22.27). Demonstrate high urban protein affordability.

- Kulon Progo: PMI 44.9 is 3x longer than Jakarta Selatan, underscoring deep rural-urban disparity.

- Kota Yogyakarta: PMI 53.7, higher than rural neighbors like Sleman (47.9), challenging assumption that cities automatically offer better affordability.

**Protein Hierarchy (Minutes of Work)**

- Basic (<20 min): Chicken in Jakarta (average 15.1 minutes). Highly affordable protein.

- Mid Tier (20–40 min): Egg, chub mackerel, and mackerel tuna are moderately accessible.

- Luxury (>40 min): Milkfish in Kulon Progo (44.9) and Yogyakarta City (53.7) takes significant work-time to afford.

**Protein Through Seasons**

- Early Year Shock (Jan): Kulon Progo’s milkfish PMI unusually low (44.9) vs. Bantul (62.9) & Gunung Kidul (56.0).
Finding: Localized market disturbances can overturn regional trends.

- Mid-Year Urban Split (Aug): Jakarta Selatan’s chicken PMI drops (14.1 → 10.9), while Jakarta Timur rises (15.9 → 17.2)
Finding: Highlights fragile urban supply chains.

- Late Year Surge (Aug–Dec): Chicken PMI generally climbs, peaking in December, though uneven across cities.
Finding: Seasonal demand spikes stress affordability & expose weak forecasting.

- All-Year Stability: Yogyakarta’s bandeng stable (53.7–55.8) across months, while eggs remain steady nationwide.
Finding: Resilient local aquaculture & poultry models offer lessons for other commodities.

**AI Support Explanation**

- Purpose: Automate insight generation and narrative summarization from structured PMI and affordability datasets.

- Method: IBM Granite summarizes numeric data into human-readable narratives, identifies disparities, seasonal trends, and outliers.

- Contribution: Generated structured bullets and short narratives showing city-level, commodity-level, and seasonal differences.

- Impact: Enabled quick, consistent, and presentation-ready insights that are directly actionable for policymakers and researchers.
